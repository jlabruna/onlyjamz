# ONLYJAMZ

OnlyJamz is the discerning nerd's GameJam prompt generator! Powered by AI (let's face it, basically everything is nowadays), OnlyJamz will generate a series of GameJam prompts for your next GameJam, sourced by Open AI's ChatGPT.

Simply select the criteria for the game prompts you would like to generate, including genre, art style, and theme, and click the Generate Ideas button. Once your ideas are generated, you can opt to get new ideas by re clicking the Generate Ideas button, or you can save an idea you like by clicking Save Idea.
