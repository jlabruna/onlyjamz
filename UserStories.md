2. As an event coordinator, I want a tool to generate Game Jam ideas in front of a live audience, so that I cannot be accused of collusion with any one team.

3. As a programmer, I want a tool that enables me to generate a random idea, save it, and build a workflow around it, so that I can practice how to properly structure an IT project

4. As a game developer, I want a tool that will generate random game ideas for me so that I can overcome "writers block".
